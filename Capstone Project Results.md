# Capstone Project Results
In this section, we will discuss the final results of the FTI Assistant Capstone project, which
includes the development and implementation of chatbots for the Faculty of Information Technology (FTI).

## Implementation of FTI Assistant Chatbot
In this Capstone Project, I succeeded in implementing a chatbot called FTI Assistant using Watsonx and Watson Assistant technology. This chatbot has
the ability to respond to questions and requests for information from users regarding FTI, such as lecturer information, academics, and more. Currently Chatbot has not been integrated into the site
However, the FTI website will be a reference for recommendations to the Faculty and University so that can be developed to provide the latest information to students or the public general.

## Results from the FTI Assistant Chatbot
Based on the test results, I can conclude several important points:
1. Ease of Use: When accessing the FTI Assistant Chatbot to search for information Regarding FTI, there are     conveniences to be had. This shows that this chatbot meet user needs well.
2. Fast Response: FTI Assistant chatbot provides fast responses to questions users based on information trained on Watsonx Lab Prompts, which helps saves users time in searching for information.
3. Chatbot answer level accuracy is not perfect: This chatbot still has levels imperfect validation of answers in response to user questions still exists some situations where the chatbot fails to understand the question correctly and provide answers that are outside the discussion. However, this error rate is minimal and can be improved through continuous updates.

## Use of the FTI Assistant Chatbot
In analyzing the use of the FTI Assistant chatbot, I observed that this chatbot was mMPU provide significant benefits to FTI users if developed further. Some of the positive results found were:
1. Improved Access to Information: FTI users or general public have easy access and quickly get to FTI related information without needing to search through different sources.
2. Time Savings: Users can quickly obtain validated information quickly and efficiently.
3. Increasing sources of information recognition: As time goes by, I guess The use of the FTI Assistant chatbot can be a forum or source of introduction information to the public.

## Conclusion
Based on the final results of the Capstone project in developing the FTI Assistant Chatbot, I can concluded that this chatbot was able to make a positive contribution in increasing access
and user convenience in searching for information related to UKSW FTI in the future. But me also realize that there are various things that must be developed further, such as needs
data regarding UKSW FTIs who must be trained using Masin Learning, especially in improving the accuracy of chatbot responses and expanding the range of its functionality so that
become more effective and efficient in its use. These are the results and analysis of FTI Assistant Capstone project. If this Chatbot is developed within the UKSW FTI environment, then
will be very useful for FTI users and become a source of information trusted and efficient within the UKSW FTI environment.
